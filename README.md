Template for a feature rich and easy to read README

## Intro

So you just decided to add a README to your project. You want to create an easy
to read and easy to navigate file.

The question is: What should you do next?

Should you create one from scratch? Find a silver bullet solution? Or is it
better to customize an already existing file?

I'm going to show you how to create a README that fits your project, is easy
to read and contains everyting you will ever need.

## What is this?

This project is an exhaustive README template that you can customize to your needs.
You can either add sections you like or remove sections you don't like. But you have
every time an example in front of you, from which you can derive from.

## Why should I use this?

There are many README templates out there so why this one? The two main reasons for this are
that they contain often too little content or they are not easy to read or navigate through.

## Getting Started

So how do you get this template to work for your project? It is easier than you think.

### Requirements

* CMake
* NMC-GCC компилятор для сборки под NeuroMatrix

### Install

Склонируйте репозиторий

```
git clone https://git.module.ru/nmc/dtp.git
```

Соберите библиотеку для x86 используя генератор msvc:
```
cmake --preset x86-msvc
```

Либо Ninja
```
cmake --preset x86-ninja
```

Соберите библиотеку для nm:
```
cmake --preset nm-release
```



### Usage



## Here is where it's your turn

Here starts the main content of your README. This is why you did it for in the first place.
To describe to future users of this project (including yourself) everything they need to know
to be able to use it and understand it.

Use visuals to help the reader understand better. An image, diagram, chart or code example says
more than thousand words

## Don't forget anything

Think hard about anything that is clear to you but might not be clear for others. Why are you
using this aproach or why did you pick this solution instead?

### Used technologies

For sure mention all the technologies you used. If the technologies age in time you don't forget
they are used and need to be replaced.

### Testing

No tests no sucess. You SHOULD have tests for every project, but do new users know how to run them?

### Logging

Logging is essential. How do you know something went wrong if the computer doesn't tell you? Logs
are the first place to search for bugs. Explain to everybody how you can customize it or used it
in the right way.

## Contribute

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

We have an exhaustive README template with many features. The README is easy to read and navigate like an article.
In our future projects we can use this template to get a great head start in creating a custom README.
